# Lab for Data Science

This repository is forked for the Lab of Data Science where we as a group have to reproduce the work of a paper. In our case we have selected the paper mentioned in the bottom and created this repo to reproduce the result.
This repository contains the following PyTorch pretrained models, inference examples:
- Omnivore Swin T
- Omnivore Swin S
- Omnivore Swin B

We reproduced the result for ImageNet dataset using these models.
